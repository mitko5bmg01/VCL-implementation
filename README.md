This is an implementation of the generative section of the paper "Variational Continual Learning" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10628).
It was produced as a part of the examination for the course "Uncertainty in Deep Learning" (University of Oxford 2024).
A report for this code was written and is uploaded in this GIT repo.

A gist of the task: use a VAE consisting of task specific and shared heads to learn a range of tasks progressively, in a continual manner. 
The given code is an application for generating MNIST digits.
